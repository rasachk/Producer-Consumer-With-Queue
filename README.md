# Producer-Consumer-With-Queue

A solution to Producer Consumer problem with the usage of queue
Our goal here is to simulate a bakery shop with all its customers, employees (servers), and all the events which include arrival of customers, queuing, receiving service from the shop and leaving. Bakery employees (servers) are our resource here which is limited and have to be shared between customers. Also, some of our customers have special membership and don't need to wait for receiving service.
